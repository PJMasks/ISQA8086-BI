## Data Analysis Project
### Project Statement
Our group aims to analyze and provide possible solutions regarding the problems identified from our dataset.  In particular we will answer the following questions:

Which state has the highest amount of funding and from which sources (Federal, State, Local)?
Is the revenue provided to each state/district directly proportionate to the number of students in each area, and if not, then why?
Is each state spending their funds in a logical and advantageous manner?
